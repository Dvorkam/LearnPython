### About:
This chapter will attempt to get you set up as fast as possible so you can start learning Python programming. We will touch upon many concepts without overly focusing on them such us virtual enviroment, source control, PEP8 coding standard and others, some only mentioned in passing. Most of these tools/ concepts will be elaborated on in subsequent lessons. I have decided to do it this way, because the utility of them is too high to avoid even at the begining, but spending too much time on them would be too tedious and would keep us away from what I consider more fun, the actual coding.

By the end of this chapter. All the tools we will need in upcomming chapters should be setup and we will be able to get to the fun stuff.

## 1.1 Download and Install Python

1. **Download Python:**

   - Open a web browser and go to the official Python website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - You'll see the latest version of Python displayed prominently. Make sure to download the **Python 3.x** version (e.g., Python 3.10, Python 3.11).

   - Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). If you're unsure, the website usually detects your operating system and suggests the correct installer.

   

2. **Install Python:**

   - After downloading the installer, locate the downloaded file (it's usually in your "Downloads" folder).
   - Double-click the installer to run it.
   - During the installation process, you'll come across a checkbox that says "Add Python X.X to PATH." Make sure this checkbox is checked. This will allow you to use Python from the command line without specifying its full path.
   - Complete the installation by following the on-screen instructions. The default settings are usually sufficient.

3. **Verify the Installation:**

   - Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Python was installed successfully by opening a command prompt or terminal window.
   - Type the following command and press Enter:

     ```
     python --version
     ```

   - You should see the version of Python you installed printed to the screen (e.g., "Python 3.9.6").

Congratulations, you've successfully installed Python on your computer! In the next steps, we'll set up a virtual environment and install some required packages to create a clean and isolated environment for your Python projects.
